## Project Overview

This project shows how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the resembling dog breed is shown.
